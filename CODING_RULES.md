# Version

Increase this version number whenever this rule file changes.

# Common Rules (All Languages)

These rules apply to all projects, regardless of language. Language-specific rules live in the
corresponding `*_RULES.md` files.

---

## Keep CODING_RULES.md in Sync

When working on a project, copy all relevant rules into the project's `CODING_RULES.md` file
(project root). The project's `CLAUDE.md` carries only a small versioned pointer block that
mandates reading `CODING_RULES.md` before code work — never the full rules, and never an
`@import` of `CODING_RULES.md` (imports auto-expand into context every turn).

- Always include all rules from `COMMON_RULES.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_FLOW.md`.
  `COMMON_RULES.md` is copied into the project's `CODING_RULES.md`;
  `IMPLEMENTATION_FLOW.md` is copied into the project's own `IMPLEMENTATION_FLOW.md`
- Also include applicable language-specific, project-type, and supplemental rule files
  (see `PROJECT_TYPES.md` for the project-type overview)
- Include optional addon rule files only when the user has opted in to that addon
- If applicability is unclear, ask the user which rules to include
- Include each source file's `# Version` block with its copied rules
- If `CODING_RULES.md` already exists, compare each source file's version with the corresponding
  copied rule block and update only stale or unversioned blocks, keeping the result deduplicated
- If `CLAUDE.md` contains inlined rule blocks or coding-rule `@import` lines from an earlier run,
  migrate that content into `CODING_RULES.md` and leave only the pointer block in `CLAUDE.md`

---

## Use Objects for Related Values

When multiple related values must be passed between classes or methods, bundle them into a
dedicated object (e.g., DTO/Settings/Config) instead of passing many parameters. This improves
readability, reduces call-site churn, and makes changes safer.

---

## No Bag-of-Keys Returns at Module Boundaries

When a public method on a manager/repository/service returns data that crosses a module
boundary, the return type must be a typed object (DTO, value object, or domain model) — never
a raw associative array indexed by string keys. Plain `array` returns silently swallow shape
bugs: a missing key reads as `null`, a list-vs-single mix-up reads as "no data", and renames
go undetected by static analysis.

- **Anti-pattern.** `getSettingsValue(...)` returns `array|null`; callers do `$result['value']`,
  `$result['type']`. A consumer mis-indexes `$result[0]['value']` after a refactor; nothing
  flags the change. The function silently returns `null` and downstream defaults take over.
- **Correct pattern.** Return a class — `getSettingsElement(...): ?SettingsElement`. The class
  exposes `getValue()`, `getType()`, `exists()`. Typed, autocompleted, statically checked;
  renames propagate via the IDE.
- **Lists vs single must be obvious from the type and the name.** `getThing(): ?Thing`
  (zero or one) vs `getThings(): ThingList` or `iterable<Thing>`. Never overload the same
  return type to mean both.
- **Distinguish absent from empty.** `null` from a lookup means "not found"; an empty
  collection means "found, but had nothing". A typed return makes this contract explicit;
  a bag-of-keys array hides it.
- **JSON-decoded blobs are arrays too.** The rule applies equally to `json_decode($column, true)`
  results that cross a module boundary — wrap them in a value object before they leave the
  layer that owns the schema.
- **Internal helpers may stay arrays.** This rule targets *public* API on managers and the
  boundary where a domain abstraction starts. Pure-private array juggling inside a single
  method is fine.

---

## Reuse Existing Models Before Inventing Array Shapes

Before designing a new return type or DTO, search the codebase for an existing domain class
that already owns the same data. Most "should this be a DTO?" decisions are actually
"is there already a `Contest` / `User` / `Order` class that should absorb this method?"

- Grep for the table name, the primary key, and the most distinctive column.
- If a model already exists with a constructor that accepts the row shape, use it — don't
  invent a parallel array shape that mirrors the same columns.
- Adding a `getXxxObject()` alongside a legacy `getXxxData()` is acceptable as a migration
  step; keep both only until consumers are migrated, then delete the array-returning version.

---

## Tests Pin the Shape Before the Refactor

When converting a bag-of-keys return to a typed object, write a **characterization test
first** that locks the current behavior using the existing API, run it green against the
unrefactored code, and then refactor. The same test (or a renamed-but-equivalent one) must
remain green afterward.

This converts "I think the new object preserves behavior" into "the test proves it." Pair
with the "Test-Driven Development" rule below — characterization tests are TDD applied to
refactors instead of new features.

---

## Test-Driven Development for Features and Bug Fixes

Follow TDD when implementing features or fixing bugs:

1. Write tests first
2. Run the tests and confirm they fail
3. Implement the change or fix
4. Run the tests again and confirm they pass

---

## Integration Tests

Every project must include integration tests in addition to unit tests. Integration tests verify that
components work correctly together and catch issues that unit tests alone cannot detect.

---

## Test Runner Scripts

Every project must provide the following batch files in the `tools/` directory:

- `tools/run_tests.bat` — runs unit tests
- `tools/run_integration_tests.bat` — runs integration tests

These scripts ensure a consistent way to execute tests across environments.

Both must **exit with the test runner's own exit code** — capture it right after the run
(`set TESTRESULT=%ERRORLEVEL%`) and end with `exit /b %TESTRESULT%`. A bat that prints
"Some tests failed!" but exits 0 reports green to CI, to callers and to AI agents. Never pipe the
test command into a filter — the pipe's exit code is the *filter's*, not the runner's; write to a
temp file and filter that instead.

---

## No `pause` in Batch Files

Batch files must never contain a `pause` line. `pause` waits for a keypress, so any bat that has one
hangs forever when run by CI, another bat, or an AI agent. End with an explicit `exit /b <code>`
instead, and let the caller decide whether to keep the window open (`cmd /k`).

---

## Prefer Type-Safe Values

Use strong, explicit types instead of loosely typed or stringly typed values (e.g., typed DTOs,
enums, generics, typed settings). This ensures mistakes are caught at compile time or by tests
early in development.

---

## String Constants

Centralize string constants in a dedicated module/class. Do not scatter raw strings across
the codebase. Use language-appropriate patterns for constants and reuse them consistently.

---

## Reusable Tooling

Before building project-specific infrastructure scripts (audits, codemods,
build helpers, lint checks, etc.) for a project, check the matching
language's `*_setup_files/` folder under this `coding-rules` repo for an
existing equivalent. If found, copy or reference it. If not:

1. Build the script in the project and prove it on real data.
2. Copy the script into the right `*_setup_files/tools/` folder.
3. Document it in that language's `*_RULES.md` so the next project picks
   it up automatically.

This keeps cross-project tooling consistent and prevents the same script
from being re-invented in every new project.

---

## README.md is Mandatory

Every project must have a `README.md` file in the root directory. It should include:

- Project name and description
- Installation/setup instructions
- Usage examples
- Dependencies and requirements

---

## Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

Avoid code duplication. If the same logic appears in multiple places, extract it into a
reusable function, class, module, or utility.

- Duplicate code is harder to maintain and leads to bugs
- Extract shared logic into helpers or base abstractions
- Use constants for repeated values

---

## Derive, Don't Duplicate — One Value Owns the Derivation

When one value strictly determines another, pass only the determinant and derive the rest —
never thread both side-by-side through call sites, constructors, and events. Two co-varying
parameters are a functional dependency in disguise; passing both lets them drift into illegal
combinations.

- **Anti-pattern.** `createLog(ActionCategory $cat, ActionType $type)` threaded through ~10
  sites. Nothing stops a caller passing `category: email, type: lead.created`.
- **Correct pattern.** The richer type owns the relationship: `ActionType::category()` returns
  its `ActionCategory` via a single exhaustive `match`. Call sites pass only `ActionType`;
  category is always derived, so a mismatch is unconstructable.
- **Apply when** one value *determines* the other (a true functional dependency).
- **Don't apply when** the relationship is many-to-many or genuinely independent — forcing a
  derivation that doesn't exist couples things that should stay separate.
- **Keep derivation cheap and pure** — a getter/match, no DB or IO behind a call that looks free.
- **Keep the mapping exhaustive** (enum + exhaustive match) so a new case cannot silently skip
  its derived value.

This is Single Source of Truth applied to parameters, and a form of "make illegal states
unrepresentable." Pairs with "Prefer Type-Safe Values" and "Self-Describing Classes".

---

## Keep It Simple (KISS)

Prefer the simplest solution that actually works. Complicated logic for a simple result must be
kept to a minimum — a future maintainer (or you, at 3am) has to understand it.

- **YAGNI.** Don't build for a need that isn't here yet: no interface with a single
  implementation, no factory for one product, no config for a value that never changes.
- **Boring over clever.** Clever is what someone decodes later. The obvious solution wins.
- **Deletion over addition.** The shortest working change is usually the right one.
- Pairs with "Don't Repeat Yourself" and "No God Classes" — simplicity is what those rules
  are protecting.

---

## Confirm Dependency Versions

Before adding any new package or library, confirm the version with the user to ensure we use
up-to-date dependencies.

- Do not assume which version to use
- Ask the user to verify the latest stable version
- Avoid outdated packages that may have security vulnerabilities or missing features

---

## Error Handling & Logging Strategy

Every project must have a centralized error handler rather than ad-hoc try/catch blocks scattered
throughout the codebase.

- Use structured logging (not `print`/`console.log`/`echo`)
- Log at appropriate levels: debug, info, warning, error
- Include context in log messages (module name, operation, relevant IDs)

---

## Centralized Logger — Single Off Switch

Route all logging through one dedicated logger class/module. Never call the language's
built-in output directly for logging (`print`, `console.log`, `echo`, `Debug.Log`,
`System.out`). Code calls the project logger; the project logger wraps the underlying sink.

- **One toggle.** Because every log goes through one place, logging can be turned off,
  level-filtered, or redirected (file, console, remote) from a single config flag — without
  touching call sites. Example: a `logEnabled` / `logLevel` setting the logger checks once.
- **Levels live in the logger.** Callers pass a level (debug/info/warning/error); the logger
  decides what is emitted based on central config. Callers never branch on "should I log?".
- **Wrap, don't scatter.** Built-in calls (`print`, framework loggers, `Debug.Log`) appear
  in exactly one file — the logger implementation. Everywhere else imports the logger.
- **Language specifics** still apply (e.g. Unity `[Conditional]` stripping, Flutter `logger`
  package, Python `logging`) — but they are configured inside the central logger, not at
  call sites.

The logger's name is fixed per language so it is the same known type in every project (see each
`*_RULES.md` for details):

| Language      | Class / export     | File                |
|---------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Python        | `AppLogger`        | `app_logger.py`     |
| PHP           | `Logger`           | `Logger.php`        |
| Dart/Flutter  | `AppLogger`        | `app_logger.dart`   |
| Kotlin        | `AppLogger`        | `AppLogger.kt`      |
| C# (plain)    | `AppLogger`        | `AppLogger.cs`      |
| Unity C#      | `GameLog` (static) | `GameLog.cs`        |
| Svelte/JS/TS  | `logger` (export)  | `logger.ts`         |
| Arduino       | `Log`              | `Log.h` / `Log.cpp` |

---

## Input Validation at Boundaries

Always validate data at system boundaries — API inputs, user input, file uploads, external service
responses.

- Never trust external data; validate before processing
- Use language-appropriate validation libraries (e.g., Pydantic, Zod, FluentValidation)
- Fail fast with clear error messages when validation fails

---

## Maximum File Length — 300 Lines

Split files when they exceed 300 lines to keep code navigable during fast iteration.

- Extract classes, functions, or components into separate modules
- Group related extractions logically (by domain, not by type)
- Exceptions: generated files, configuration files, test files with many similar cases

---

## Naming Conventions

Be consistent within a project. Follow these defaults unless the language or framework dictates
otherwise:

- Files: `snake_case` (or language convention, e.g., `PascalCase` for C# classes)
- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Functions/methods: language convention (`snake_case` for Python/PHP, `camelCase` for Dart/JS/C#)
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Variables: language convention (`snake_case` for Python/PHP, `camelCase` for Dart/JS/C#)

---

## Comments Explain Why, Not What

Comment intent and non-obvious reasoning — not a restatement of the code. Good names carry the
*what*; comments carry the *why*.

- **Anti-pattern.** `i++ // increment i`. Redundant comments add noise and rot the moment the
  code changes.
- **Correct pattern.** Document *why* a workaround exists, why a non-obvious algorithm was
  chosen, or a constraint that isn't visible locally (`// API rejects batches > 500`).
- Prefer self-documenting code (clear names, small functions) over a comment that compensates
  for unclear code — see "Naming Conventions" and "Keep It Simple".
- Document the purpose of each module/class at its top.
- Keep comments in sync with the code; delete stale ones rather than letting them mislead.

---

## Security Baseline

Every project must follow these minimum security practices:

- Never commit secrets (`.env`, API keys, credentials, private keys)
- Escape output to prevent XSS/injection attacks
- Use parameterized queries or ORM-provided methods — never concatenate user input into queries
- Validate and sanitize all user input at system boundaries
- Keep dependencies updated to avoid known vulnerabilities

---

## No Hardcoded Environment Values

Never hardcode environment-specific values in code — filesystem paths, hostnames, IP addresses,
ports, base URLs. They differ across machines and environments and make code non-portable.

- **Anti-pattern.** `connect("192.168.1.50:5432")`, `open("C:\\Users\\bob\\data\\out.json")`.
- **Correct pattern.** Read them from the project's central config (the config class each
  `*_RULES.md` already mandates), with a committed `.example` template documenting every key.
- Distinct from the secrets rule above: this is about **portability** (runs anywhere), not
  secrecy. A non-secret hostname still belongs in config, not in code.

---

## No God Classes

A class that handles too many responsibilities becomes fragile, hard to test, and impossible to
reuse. Keep each class focused on a single purpose.

- **Warning signs**: more than 5 public methods, more than 4 constructor dependencies, or methods that span unrelated domains (e.g., a class that validates input, queries the database, and sends emails)
- Split by responsibility: extract collaborators (e.g., a `Validator`, a `Repository`, a `Notifier`) rather than piling logic into one class
- If you struggle to name the class without using "Manager", "Handler", "Service", or "Helper" as a catch-all, it likely does too much
- This complements the 300-line file rule — a short class can still be a god class if it owns too many concerns

---

## Self-Describing Classes

When behavior depends on which fields or properties a class has — such as search, serialization,
display, validation, or auditing — the class itself must declare those fields through a contract
(interface, abstract method, attribute/annotation, or introspection pattern). Never hardcode field
lists in consuming code.

- **Anti-pattern**: A search service contains a hardcoded list of fields to index for each entity;
  adding a new field requires updating every consumer manually
- **Correct pattern**: Each class implements a contract (e.g., `GetSearchableFields()`,
  `GetDisplayColumns()`) that returns its own relevant fields, so adding a field in one place
  automatically propagates everywhere
- This applies to any cross-cutting concern that operates over class fields: search, filtering,
  export, form generation, diffing, logging, etc.
- Combine with compile-time checks where the language supports them (e.g., sealed interfaces,
  exhaustive matching) to ensure new fields cannot be silently ignored

---

## Inject Collaborators, Don't Fold Dependencies In

Composition reuse comes in two shapes, and they differ sharply in how much coupling they add to
the reusing class. **Folding** a helper into a class (mixin, trait, multiple inheritance, copy-in
include) merges *all of the helper's own dependencies* into that class — reuse five such helpers
and every one of their imports is now the host's coupling. **Injecting** a collaborator adds a
single dependency: the collaborator, which is built once and shared as a hub.

Prefer injected collaborators. Reserve fold-in reuse for helpers that are stateless and carry no
dependencies of their own.

- **Anti-pattern**: A controller reuses five behavior mixins/traits; each brings its own service,
  DTO, and constant imports, so the controller transitively depends on a few dozen things and is
  hard to test in isolation.
- **Correct pattern**: Extract that behavior into a collaborator object injected via the
  constructor. The controller depends on the collaborator; the collaborator is reused across many
  controllers as a shared, well-tested hub.

### Inject services; never instantiate one inside a method

Constructing a service with `new` (or the language equivalent) inside a method hides the
dependency from the class's public contract and makes it impossible to substitute in a test. Pass
collaborators in through the constructor.

- **Anti-pattern**: A method does `helper = new EmailPreparer(); helper.prepare(...)`. Nothing in
  the class signature reveals the dependency, and no test can replace it.
- **Correct pattern**: Inject `EmailPreparer` once; the method calls the injected instance.

### Collapse config-callback swarms into one value object

When a base class pulls its configuration from the subclass through many small overridable getters
that the subclass fills in one-line-each, each getter is a separate touch-point and the wiring is
spread across dozens of methods. Bundle the related values into a single config object built once
and handed to the base (see **Use Objects for Related Values**). This also keeps such classes off
the wrong side of **No God Classes**.

- **Anti-pattern**: A subclass implements `getSendEndpoint()`, `getSendSuccessKey()`,
  `getSendFailureRedirect()`, and a dozen more one-line getters, each naming one constant.
- **Correct pattern**: The subclass builds one `SendConfig` value object once; the base reads its
  fields.

# Version

Increase this version number whenever this rule file changes.

# Python Rules (uv)

See `COMMON_RULES.md` for rules that apply to all languages.

## Template Engine

Keep Python, HTML, CSS, and JS separated.
This means using a template engine.

Use Jinja2:

```bash
uv add jinja2
```

Do not put JS code into templates. Use separate `.js` files.

Example structure:

```
project/
├── app/
├── templates/
└── static/
    ├── css/
    └── js/
```

Example template:

```html
<!-- templates/page.html -->
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/app.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
    <script src="/static/js/app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

---

## GUI Framework

For **desktop GUI** applications use **PySide6** (Qt for Python). Always install the
latest version — do not pin an old one:

```bash
uv add pyside6
```

This is separate from the web template engine above: Jinja2 renders web HTML,
PySide6 builds native desktop windows. Pick by app type.

### Make it look modern

Default Qt reads as a debug tool: gradient buttons, boxed tabs, a caption bar in the
user's OS accent color, no type hierarchy. Follow
[`python_setup_files/MODERN_GUI.md`](python_setup_files/MODERN_GUI.md) — the palette /
stylesheet / icons / window-chrome module split, the vendored-and-tinted icon recipe,
the Qt gotchas that break a restyle (size policies, per-widget fonts, minimum-size
floors, focus rings), and how to screenshot pages offscreen to verify it.

The design decisions behind it — tokens, one accent, hierarchy, focus states, empty and
error states — are language-independent and live in `DESIGN_RULES.md`.

---

## CLI Menus

For **interactive command-line** applications, never hand-roll a menu out of `input()`
and printed option lists. Use **`pick`** — an arrow-key menu with a selection
indicator, scrolling for long lists, and optional multiselect — on its **blessed**
backend:

```bash
uv add "pick[blessed]"
```

**Always pass `backend="blessed"`.** `pick`'s default curses backend breaks on Windows
the moment the program runs a child that inherits the console — a `git` call, a build
step, anything streaming its output live. From then on curses stops translating the
arrow keys for the rest of the process: the keys still arrive, but as raw `ESC [ A`
sequences that `pick` ignores, so every later menu draws and then accepts nothing. It
looks like a hang and it is sticky — re-initialising curses does not recover it, and
neither does restoring the console mode. Only never letting the child touch the console
(capturing its output, which costs live streaming) or decoding the sequences avoids it.
blessed decodes them, so subprocesses keep the console and their live output.

### Wrap it — one menu helper per project

Never import `pick` at more than one call site. Wrap it in a single helper class
(e.g. `menu.py` / `UserChoicesHandler`) so keyboard handling, the indicator style,
and Ctrl-C behavior are defined once:

```py
# src/<pkg>/menu.py
import sys
from pick import pick


def show_menu(
    options: list[str],
    title: str,
    indicator: str = "*",
    default_index: int = 0,
) -> int:
    """Show an arrow-key menu; return the selected index. Ctrl-C exits."""
    try:
        _, index = pick(
            options=options,
            title=title,
            indicator=indicator,
            default_index=default_index,
            backend="blessed",  # never the curses default: see above
        )
        return index
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        sys.exit(1)
```

### Keep option labels and actions in step

The menu returns an **index**, not a parsed letter. Build the label list and a parallel
list of typed action values (enum members — see "Prefer Type-Safe Values") in the same
place, so an option can never be shown without a handler:

```py
options: list[str] = []
actions: list[MenuAction] = []
options.append("Commit"); actions.append(MenuAction.COMMIT)
if repo.has_untracked:
    options.append("Add all"); actions.append(MenuAction.ADD_ALL)
options.append("Cancel"); actions.append(MenuAction.CANCEL)

action = actions[show_menu(options, title)]
```

### Testing

`pick` needs a real terminal, so tests must not call it. Patch the project's wrapper
(`show_menu`) — not `pick` itself — and assert on the option labels it was handed:

```py
monkeypatch.setattr("<pkg>.menu.show_menu", lambda options, title, **kw: 0)
```

Keep a non-interactive path for every menu (a CLI flag, or auto-select when there is a
single option) so the program stays scriptable and testable without a TTY. Have the
wrapper refuse outright when `sys.stdin`/`sys.stdout` is not a TTY: without a console the
menu blocks on a key that can never arrive, which reads as a freeze rather than an error.

Because the tests patch the wrapper, nothing in the suite ever drives a real menu — so
also keep a small manual script (`tools/menu_smoke.py` + a `.bat`) that opens a menu, runs
a subprocess inheriting the console, then opens another menu. That second menu is exactly
what the curses backend breaks, and only a human at a terminal can see it.

---

## Localization

Use the `python-localization` library for multi-language support:
https://github.com/BenjaminKobjolke/python-localization

### Installation (uv)

#### Option A (recommended): Add as dependency to the project

```bash
uv add "git+https://github.com/BenjaminKobjolke/python-localization.git"
```

#### Option B: Install into the current environment (without adding to project deps)

```bash
uv pip install "git+https://github.com/BenjaminKobjolke/python-localization.git"
```

### Directory Structure

```
project/
├── lang/
│   ├── en.json    # English (default)
│   ├── de.json    # German
│   └── fr.json    # French
├── app/
└── templates/
```

### Translation File Format

Create `lang/en.json` with nested structure:

```json
{
  "nav": {
    "dashboard": "Dashboard",
    "settings": "Settings",
    "logout": "Logout"
  },
  "auth": {
    "login_title": "Login",
    "signin_subtitle": "Sign in to access your dashboard",
    "error": {
      "auth_failed": "Authentication failed. Please try again.",
      "rate_limited": "Too many attempts. Please try again later."
    }
  },
  "flash": {
    "success": {
      "saved": "Changes saved successfully.",
      "deleted": "Item deleted successfully."
    },
    "error": {
      "not_found": "Item not found.",
      "invalid_id": "Invalid ID."
    }
  },
  "common": {
    "cancel": "Cancel",
    "save": "Save",
    "delete": "Delete",
    "edit": "Edit"
  }
}
```

### Python Setup

#### Container Integration

Add a method to your DI container:

```py
# app/container.py
from pathlib import Path

# Adjust import to the real package name of your library
# from python_localization import Localization

class Container:
    def __init__(self, base_dir: Path):
        self.base_dir = base_dir
        self._localization = None

    def get_localization(self):
        if self._localization is None:
            self._localization = Localization(
                driver="json",
                lang_dir=str(self.base_dir / "lang"),
                default_lang="en",
                fallback_lang="en",
            )
        return self._localization
```

#### Controller Helper

Add translation helper to your base controller:

```py
# app/web/base_controller.py
class BaseController:
    def __init__(self, container):
        self.container = container

    def get_localization(self):
        return self.container.get_localization()

    def t(self, key: str, params: dict[str, object] | None = None) -> str:
        return self.get_localization().t(key, params or {})
        # or .translate(...) / .lang(...), depending on your library
```

Usage in controllers:

```py
from app.i18n.keys import TK

# Simple translation
self.add_flash("success", self.t(TK.FLASH_SUCCESS_SAVED))

# With placeholders
self.add_flash("info", self.t("messages.welcome", {":name": user.name}))
```

---

## Jinja2 Integration

### Add the `t()` Function

Where you configure Jinja2:

```py
# app/web/templates.py
from jinja2 import Environment, FileSystemLoader
from app.i18n.keys import TK

def create_env(localization, templates_dir: str) -> Environment:
    env = Environment(loader=FileSystemLoader(templates_dir), autoescape=True)

    def t(key: str, params: dict[str, object] | None = None) -> str:
        return localization.t(key, params or {})

    env.globals["t"] = t
    env.globals["TK"] = TK
    return env
```

### Usage in Templates

Simple translations:

```html
<h1>{{ t(TK.NAV_DASHBOARD) }}</h1>
<button>{{ t(TK.COMMON_SAVE) }}</button>
<a href="/logout">{{ t(TK.NAV_LOGOUT) }}</a>
```

With placeholders (define in JSON as `:placeholder`):

```json
{
  "messages": {
    "welcome": "Hello, :name!",
    "items_count": "You have :count items"
  }
}
```

```html
<p>{{ t("messages.welcome", {":name": user.name}) }}</p>
<p>{{ t("messages.items_count", {":count": items|length}) }}</p>
```

Conditional content:

```html
{% if error == "auth_failed" %}
  {{ t("auth.error.auth_failed") }}
{% elif error == "rate_limited" %}
  {{ t("auth.error.rate_limited") }}
{% endif %}
```

In attributes:

```html
<a href="/back" title="{{ t('common.back') }}">
  <i class="icon-back"></i>
</a>

<button onclick="return confirm('{{ t('confirm.delete') }}')">
  {{ t('common.delete') }}
</button>
```

## Translation Key Naming Convention

Use dot notation with logical grouping:

```
section.subsection.key

nav.dashboard            - Navigation items
auth.login_title         - Authentication related
flash.success.saved      - Flash messages by type
flash.error.not_found
form.label.name          - Form labels
form.placeholder.email   - Form placeholders
form.validation.required - Validation messages
common.save              - Reusable UI elements
errors.404.title         - Error pages
```

---

## Translation Keys as Constants

Using raw strings like `t("nav.dashboard")` is error-prone. Create a `TK` class with all keys as constants for IDE autocomplete and refactoring safety.

Create `app/i18n/keys.py`:

```py
# app/i18n/keys.py
class TK:
    # Navigation
    NAV_DASHBOARD = "nav.dashboard"
    NAV_SETTINGS = "nav.settings"
    NAV_LOGOUT = "nav.logout"

    # Auth
    AUTH_LOGIN_TITLE = "auth.login_title"
    AUTH_ERROR_AUTH_FAILED = "auth.error.auth_failed"

    # Flash messages
    FLASH_SUCCESS_SAVED = "flash.success.saved"
    FLASH_ERROR_NOT_FOUND = "flash.error.not_found"

    # Common
    COMMON_CANCEL = "common.cancel"
    COMMON_SAVE = "common.save"
```

Usage in controllers:

```py
from app.i18n.keys import TK
self.add_flash("success", self.t(TK.FLASH_SUCCESS_SAVED))
```

Usage in templates:

```html
{{ t(TK.NAV_DASHBOARD) }}
```

### Benefits

* IDE autocomplete for all translation keys
* Refactoring support
* Easy to find all usages of a key
* Fewer typos / runtime missing-key bugs

---

## Adding New Languages

1. Copy `lang/en.json` to `lang/de.json`
2. Translate all values (keep keys identical)
3. Change language in configuration:

```py
self._localization = Localization(
    driver="json",
    lang_dir=str(self.base_dir / "lang"),
    default_lang="de",
    fallback_lang="en",
)
```

---

## Project Setup Scripts

Copy the setup batch files from the `python_setup_files/` folder bundled with the
coding-rules plugin (next to this rules file).

### install.bat

Initial project setup:

- Checks if `uv` is installed
- Creates virtual environment via `uv sync --all-extras`
- Runs tests to verify setup

### update.bat

Update all dependencies:

- Updates lock file with `uv lock --upgrade`
- Syncs updated dependencies
- Runs linting checks (`ruff`, `mypy`)
- Runs tests to verify compatibility

### tools/run_tests.bat

Run the test suite:

- Runs `pytest tests/ -v` with verbose output
- Shows pass/fail summary
- Projects that split unit/integration point it at `tests/unit`

### tools/run_integration_tests.bat

Run the integration test suite:

- Runs `pytest tests/integration -v`
- Same uv check + summary as run_tests.bat

### Usage

```bash
# First time setup
install.bat

# Run tests
tools\run_tests.bat

# Update dependencies
update.bat
```

---

## Release Workflow

Set up the release system with `/release:setup`. Reusable pieces live in
`python_setup_files/`:

- `tools/release/build_number.py` — self-contained helper: manages the integer in
  `build_version.txt` (project root) and prints the `<version>_<build>` label
  (version from `pyproject.toml`). Actions: `get | increment | decrement | label`.
- `tools/build_get.bat`, `tools/build_increment.bat`, `tools/build_decrement.bat`,
  `tools/version_get.bat` — thin `uv run` wrappers over the helper.
- `CREATE_NEW_RELEASE.template.md` — fill-in-the-blanks for `docs/CREATE_NEW_RELEASE.md`.
- The Python stack recipe read by `/release:create-release-notes` lives in the shared
  `coding-rules/CREATE_RELEASE_NOTES.md` (`## Python / uv` section), not here.

Conventions:

- **Release label** = `<version>_<build>` (e.g. `0.1.0_22`). `version` is semver in
  `pyproject.toml` (bumped by hand); `build` is an integer in `build_version.txt`.
- **Release notes** = `release_notes/<version>_<build>/<locale>.json`. The actual
  text is the `notes` array. Author **only `en.json`**; generate other locales with
  a translation bat (mandatory — never skip).
- **Bundle `release_notes/` into the build** so the in-app view ships with the binary
  (PyInstaller: add to spec `datas` + `copy_metadata(<pkg>)`).
- **In-app view**: load all releases, sort **newest first**, show the latest first
  with Older/Newer navigation, fall back to `en.json` when a locale is missing.

---

## Windows Installer (NSIS)

Ship a single `…Setup.exe`, not a zipped folder. Use **NSIS** (`makensis`) — it is
the tool already in use across these projects, and a hand-written `.nsi` is ~100
lines. Do not reach for Inno Setup, WiX, or fbs: fbs generates its NSIS script for
you but drags in a whole build system, and a plain `uv run pyinstaller` project does
not need one.

Reusable pieces in `python_setup_files/`:

- `installer/setup.nsi.template` — the script; fill in app name, exe name, company.
- `tools/build_installer.bat` — packages an existing `dist/<App>/` into the setup exe.
- `tools/sign_exe.bat` — code-signs one exe via the XIDA network-share handshake.

Conventions:

- **Two separate bats, no chaining.** `tools/compile_exe.bat` freezes;
  `tools/build_installer.bat` packages and fails with "run compile_exe.bat first" if
  `dist/` is missing. Neither bat calls the other.
- **Version and build reach the installer as `/D` defines** from the bat
  (`/DVERSION= /DBUILD= /DSRCDIR= /DOUTFILE=`), never via the exe's version resource.
  A bare PyInstaller CLI build has no `--version-file`, so there is no resource to
  read — the bat owns the label. `tools/version_get.bat` already prints the full
  `<version>_<build>` label, so read it once and split on `_` rather than also
  calling `build_get.bat`.
- **Output** = `dist/<App>Setup_<version>_<build>.exe`, so the filename carries the
  release label (see **Release Workflow** above).
- **Exclude the app's own runtime files from the payload**:
  `File /r /x settings.json /x sessions.db "${SRCDIR}\*.*"`. PyInstaller builds into
  `dist/`, and every local test run of that exe drops its config and database right
  beside it. Without the exclusions the installer ships the developer's machine
  config and personal data to every user. Verify by listing the install directory
  after a test install — this is not theoretical, it happened.
- **Per-user install into `$LOCALAPPDATA` with `RequestExecutionLevel user`** whenever
  the app writes its data next to its own exe (the
  `DATA_ROOT = Path(sys.executable).parent` pattern). A `C:\Program Files` install
  cannot write there unelevated. Bonus: no UAC prompt at all.
- **Kill the running instance before install and uninstall**:
  `nsExec::Exec 'taskkill /F /IM "${EXENAME}"'`. Ships with Windows, needs no NSIS
  plugin, and a non-zero exit just means it was not running. Without it, upgrading
  while the app is open fails on a locked file.
- **Never delete user data on uninstall.** Remove the program files, shortcuts and
  the `HKCU\...\Uninstall\<App>` key; leave `settings.json` and the database. Use
  plain `RMDir` (not `/r`) on the install root so the folder survives when they do.
- **Registry** goes under `HKCU` (per-user install) with `DisplayName`,
  `DisplayVersion` = the full label, `Publisher`, `DisplayIcon`, `InstallLocation`,
  `UninstallString`, `EstimatedSize`.
- **Signing is opt-in** via `build_installer.bat --sign`, off by default: the XIDA
  handshake needs the `//XIDA-SERVER` share and takes ~5 minutes per binary, so local
  test builds stay unsigned. When on, sign the app exe **before** packaging (the
  signed binary must be the one inside) and the setup exe after. `sign_exe.bat` `cd`s
  into the release-tool checkout, so it must be handed an **absolute** path.
- **Test the installer silently**, no clicking: `Setup.exe /S`, then
  `Uninstall.exe /S`. Check the install dir contents, the Start Menu shortcut, the
  `HKCU` key, that the installed app can write its database, and that a reinstall
  over a running instance succeeds.

# 8 Essential Additional Rules (must-have)

## 1) Use `pyproject.toml` as the single source of truth

No scattered config files. Keep tooling config in `pyproject.toml` (and commit `uv.lock`).

Recommended baseline:

* Python version pinned (e.g. `>=3.11,<3.13`)
* Dependencies managed via `uv add ...`
* Lockfile committed: `uv.lock`

---

## 2) Enforce formatting + linting + type checking in CI

Minimum toolchain:

```bash
uv add --dev ruff mypy
```

Rules:

* Ruff handles lint + formatting (replace black/isort/flake8).
* MyPy (or pyright) for typing.
* CI must run: `ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, `mypy`.

---

## 3) Require type hints on public APIs

Rule of thumb:

* All public functions/classes/methods: typed parameters + return types.
* Use `typing` well: `Sequence`, `Mapping`, `Protocol`, `TypedDict`, `Literal` when helpful.
* Avoid `Any` unless you have a boundary (I/O, third-party libs).

---

## 4) Centralize configuration with environment-driven settings

No “magic values” in code. Use a single settings module with env overrides.

```py
# app/config/settings.py
from dataclasses import dataclass
import os

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Settings:
    env: str = os.getenv("APP_ENV", "dev")
    debug: bool = os.getenv("DEBUG", "0") == "1"
    default_lang: str = os.getenv("DEFAULT_LANG", "en")
```

Everything reads from `Settings`, not directly from `os.getenv()` scattered around.

---

## 5) Tests are mandatory, fast, and isolated

Use pytest:

```bash
uv add --dev pytest
```

Rules:

* Unit tests for core logic.
* No network in unit tests.
* Use tmp dirs / fixtures; no reliance on developer machine state.
* Run tests in CI on every push.

---

## 6) Database access uses SQLAlchemy ORM

If a database is needed, use SQLAlchemy ORM (not raw SQL or ad-hoc drivers).

---

## 7) Use `spec=` with MagicMock to catch interface mismatches

`MagicMock` without `spec` accepts **any** attribute, even non-existent ones:

```python
# BAD - No interface validation
mock = MagicMock()
mock.nonexistent_attribute = "test"  # Silently works
mock.typo_method()                   # Also works - won't catch bugs!
```

**Always use `spec=ClassName`** to validate against the real interface:

```python
# GOOD - Validates against real class
from unittest.mock import MagicMock
from mylib import EmailMessage

mock = MagicMock(spec=EmailMessage)
mock.nonexistent = "test"  # AttributeError - catches the bug!
```

### Common Pitfall: Mocking Methods vs Attributes

If the real class has a **method**, mock it as a method:

```python
# Real class has: def get_body(self) -> str
class EmailMessage:
    def get_body(self) -> str:
        return "content"

# WRONG - Creates fake attribute that doesn't exist
mock = MagicMock()
mock.body = "test"  # EmailMessage has no .body attribute!

# CORRECT - Mock the actual method
mock = MagicMock(spec=EmailMessage)
mock.get_body.return_value = "test"
```

### Quick Reference

```python
from unittest.mock import MagicMock, patch

# Mock with spec (recommended)
mock_obj = MagicMock(spec=RealClass)

# Mock method return value
mock_obj.method_name.return_value = "value"

# Mock method to raise exception
mock_obj.method_name.side_effect = ValueError("error")

# Mock property (use PropertyMock)
from unittest.mock import PropertyMock
type(mock_obj).prop_name = PropertyMock(return_value="value")

# Patch with spec
with patch("module.ClassName", spec=RealClass) as mock_cls:
    mock_cls.return_value.method.return_value = "value"
```

---

## 8) Required Batch Files

Every project must include these batch files:

* `start.bat` - In the root directory, starts the application
* `tools/run_tests.bat` - Runs the test suite

---

## Async Patterns

Use `asyncio` for I/O-bound tasks (network requests, file I/O, database queries). Avoid blocking
calls (`time.sleep`, synchronous HTTP) in async contexts — they block the entire event loop.

---

## Validation

Use Pydantic for request and data validation at API boundaries. Define models for incoming data
and let Pydantic handle type coercion and error reporting.

---

## Structured Logging

Use `structlog` or the `logging` module with JSON formatters — not `print()`. Configure a
centralized logging setup that all modules use consistently.

Route all logging through one class named **`AppLogger`** (`app_logger.py`) that wraps
`structlog`/`logging`. Feature code calls `AppLogger`, never `logging.getLogger(...)` or
`print()` directly — this gives a single enable/level toggle without touching call sites.

---

## Self-Describing Classes

Implement the common "Self-Describing Classes" rule using a Protocol/ABC or dataclass field
metadata.

### Option A: Protocol with abstract method

```python
from typing import Protocol


class Searchable(Protocol):
    def get_searchable_fields(self) -> list[str]: ...


class Customer:
    def __init__(self, name: str, email: str, phone: str) -> None:
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.phone = phone

    def get_searchable_fields(self) -> list[str]:
        return [self.name, self.email, self.phone]
```

### Option B: Dataclass field metadata

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field, fields

SEARCHABLE = "searchable"


@dataclass
class Customer:
    name: str = field(metadata={SEARCHABLE: True})
    email: str = field(metadata={SEARCHABLE: True})
    internal_notes: str = field(default="", metadata={SEARCHABLE: False})


def get_searchable_values(obj: object) -> list[str]:
    return [getattr(obj, f.name) for f in fields(obj) if f.metadata.get(SEARCHABLE)]
```

Prefer the Protocol approach for simple cases. Use dataclass metadata when you need declarative
per-field control without writing boilerplate methods.

# Version

Increase this version number whenever this rule file changes.

# Design Rules (All Languages)

See `COMMON_RULES.md` for rules that apply to all languages. These rules apply to
anything with a user interface — desktop app, web frontend, mobile app, CLI TUI.

They are about **decisions**, not about a framework. The per-stack implementation
guides are:

- `python_setup_files/MODERN_GUI.md` — PySide6 desktop apps
- `project_type/FRONTEND.md` — web SPAs (Vite, Tailwind, dark mode)

Default UI toolkits ship a *safe* look, not a good one: gradient buttons, boxed tabs,
every control the same size, no hierarchy. An interface built from defaults reads as a
debug tool no matter how good the code behind it is.

---

## Tokens, Not Values

Every color, spacing step, radius, and font size is a **named token defined once**.
Call sites reference the token; nothing hardcodes `#2B2B2B` or `13px`.

- **Anti-pattern.** A hex color appears on four screens. Changing the theme means
  finding all four, and the one you miss is the one the user sees.
- **Correct pattern.** One palette/theme module (a frozen dataclass, a CSS custom
  property block, a `ThemeData`) that every screen reads.
- This is "String Constants" and DRY applied to design. The moment a value appears
  twice, it is a token.

---

## One Accent Color

Pick **one** accent and use it only for: the selected navigation item, the focus ring,
the primary action, and progress. Everything else is a neutral.

- An interface where the accent frames the window, fills the title bar, and outlines
  every button has no accent — it has a background color.
- Semantic colors (success green, error red) are separate tokens and do **not** follow
  the accent. If a status color must match another app or a spec, comment the field
  saying so, so a theme change does not silently redefine it.
- Never encode information in color alone — pair it with a glyph, a label, or a
  position (colorblind users, grayscale printing, low-quality projectors).

---

## Neutral Ramp Before Color

A dark theme needs at least: window background, an elevated surface, a control fill,
its hover and pressed states, a border, primary text, and muted text. Most of a good
interface is that ramp; color is the exception on top of it.

Body text on the background must clear **4.5:1** contrast (3:1 for large text and for
UI borders that carry meaning). Muted text is muted, not unreadable — check it, don't
eyeball it.

---

## Hierarchy Is Type and Space, Not Boxes

Three levels are usually enough: a page heading, a muted one-line explanation, and body
or control text. Give each a token (size + weight), and build them with a **shared
factory** (`heading()` / `subheading()`), never by repeating the styling on each screen.

- Separate groups with whitespace before you separate them with a border, and with a
  border before you separate them with a filled box.
- A screen that is all boxes has no hierarchy — everything is equally important, which
  means nothing is.
- Use a consistent spacing scale (4/8/12/16/24…) rather than whatever number closed the
  gap on that one screen.

---

## Size Controls by Importance

Controls should not all be the same size, and the primary action should not be the same
weight as its neighbors. A grid of six identical giant buttons is as flat as a grid of
six identical tiny ones.

- Primary action: filled, accent.
- Secondary: outlined or flat with accent text.
- Rare actions (a custom value, an advanced group): folded away behind a toggle or a
  collapsed section — present, not prominent.

---

## Every Focusable Control Has a Visible Focus State

The moment you give a control a custom background, the toolkit's own focus ring
disappears. Re-add it explicitly, in the accent, on **every** focusable control —
buttons, fields, lists, tabs.

Keyboard users, accessibility tooling, and your own automated tests all navigate by
focus. This is not decoration; a UI with an invisible focus ring is unusable without a
mouse. Tab through the entire interface once before calling a restyle done.

---

## Never Set a Minimum Size to Fix a Layout

If content is too tall or too wide, make it **scroll or wrap** — do not pin the window.
A minimum size set to fix one screen becomes a floor every other screen inherits,
including screens the user is not looking at (tab and stack containers report their
largest child's minimum as their own).

- Wrap every page/route in a scrolling container.
- Word-wrap explanatory text; an unwrapped sentence sets the width floor.
- Then pin it with a test: assert the window resizes to something tiny, and assert the
  stylesheet contains no minimum-size rule.

---

## Own the Window Chrome

On desktop, the title bar and window frame belong to the OS and default to the user's
system accent color. A carefully themed dark app with a bright green caption bar looks
broken. Set the caption and border explicitly, and make the call a **silent no-op** on
platforms and OS versions that do not support it.

---

## Icons: Vendor a Subset, Recolor in Code

- Vendor the SVGs you actually use into the repo, with the upstream `LICENSE` and a
  header naming the set and version. Never fetch icon assets at runtime, and never add
  a whole icon-font dependency for six glyphs.
- Recolor from a palette token in code rather than committing one file per color.
- Cache by `(name, color)`.
- Keep icon sizes on the same scale as the type — an icon that is not aligned to the
  text baseline or optical center reads as a mistake.

---

## Design the Empty, Loading, and Error States

Every list has a first run. Every request fails sometimes. A screen designed only for
the happy path ships a blank rectangle to every new user.

- **Empty**: say what would be here and how to get one.
- **Loading**: keep the layout stable — never let content jump when it arrives.
- **Error**: say what failed and what to do next, in the interface, not only in a log.
- **Validation**: show it where the input is, not in a dialog. If the user can see the
  field, tell them there instead of silently falling back to a default.

---

## Follow the Platform, Then Be Consistent

Match the platform's conventions for window controls, menus, shortcuts, and dialogs
before inventing your own. Inside your app, be *ruthlessly* consistent: the same action
looks the same everywhere, the same spacing separates the same kinds of things, the
same word means the same thing on every screen.

If two of your own screens disagree, the screens are wrong — not the user.

---

## Localize From the Start

Every user-visible string goes through the translation layer with a key constant, never
a raw string at a call site. Layouts must survive a translation that is 40% longer:
wrap text, avoid fixed-width labels, and never build a sentence by concatenating
fragments — translate the whole sentence with placeholders.

---

## Verify Visually, and Automate It

A restyle is not done because the tests pass — tests do not look at the screen.

- Render each screen to an image (offscreen/headless is fine and deterministic) and
  actually look at all of them after a change.
- Check the app at its smallest supported size, not just the size it opens at.
- Automate what an image cannot assert: no minimum-size rule in the theme, a focus style
  on every control, a recolored icon that still has pixels.
- Never drive a real window with synthetic mouse clicks to capture screenshots — the
  moment focus moves, those clicks land in someone else's application.

---

# graphify Knowledge Graph (Optional Addon)

**Optional.** Before adding this to a project, ASK the user whether they want to use graphify.
Only wire it into the project's `CODING_RULES.md` if they say yes.

graphify turns a code folder into a queryable knowledge graph — god nodes, communities,
cross-file relationships, fan-in/fan-out. Use it to orient before grep and to spot god classes.

**Keep the build AST-only (no LLM, no API cost) by scoping to the code dir.** graphify runs a
free deterministic AST pass on *code* files, but a separate **LLM pass** on every *non-code*
file — docs, `.md`, `.txt`, config `.yaml`, images (vision), audio/video (whisper). That pass
needs an LLM (Gemini key or the host agent) and costs tokens. A build scoped to a pure-code dir
(`lib/`, `src/`, `app/`) has zero non-code files, so it skips the LLM pass entirely and rebuilds
need no AI. A repo-root build (`/graphify .`) sweeps in `docs/`, `README.md`, icons, and sound
assets — forcing the LLM pass. **Always scope to the code dir; never build the repo root.**

---

## One-time setup

1. **Install the Claude Code integration** (writes a generic graphify section into `CLAUDE.md`
   plus PreToolUse hooks that consult the graph before grep/read):
   ```
   /graphify claude install
   ```
2. **Check `.claude/settings.json` for the Windows slash bug.** On Windows the installer writes
   the hook command with backslash paths, e.g. `C:\\Users\\<you>\\.local\\bin\\graphify.EXE`.
   Claude Code runs PreToolUse hooks through Git Bash, which strips the backslashes →
   `C:Users<you>.local...` → `command not found` on every Bash/Read/Glob. Fix: open
   `.claude/settings.json` and replace the backslashes in the hook `command`(s) with forward
   slashes — `C:/Users/<you>/.local/bin/graphify.EXE` (Git Bash accepts drive paths with `/`).
   Also dedupe: the installer may write a redundant backslash `Bash` entry alongside a correct
   `Bash|Grep` one — keep exactly two entries (`Bash|Grep`, `Read|Glob`), forward slashes.
   Then confirm it runs: `"C:/Users/<you>/.local/bin/graphify.EXE" hook-guard search`.
   Note: Claude Code may permission-block edits to `.claude/settings.json` — the user may need
   to explicitly request/approve the fix. Hooks written mid-session don't load until the user
   opens `/hooks` once or restarts the session.
   (Non-Windows hosts are unaffected — skip this step.)
3. **Build the first graph — scoped and directed.** Point it at the folder that holds the
   source code, NOT the repo root:
   ```
   /graphify <code-dir> --directed        # e.g. src/  app/  lib/  internal/
   ```
   - `<code-dir>` = the folder(s) with the code. Scoping keeps `vendor/`, `node_modules/`,
     build output, and tests out of the graph. A repo-root build drowns the signal in deps AND
     drags in non-code files (`docs/`, `*.md`, images, audio) that force the paid LLM pass — a
     scoped code-dir build stays AST-only and free (see intro).
   - **If first-party code lives in MORE than one top-level dir (e.g. `application/` +
     `framework/`, `src/` + `lib/`), build ALL of them as one multi-path merged graph:**
     `/graphify application/ framework/ --directed`. Scoping to only one dir makes every class
     in the others invisible to every query — the graph then reports "not found" for code that
     exists, and the miss is indistinguishable from absence. (Real incident: a query for string
     sanitization helpers returned 61 irrelevant nodes because `FRK_StringHelper` lived in the
     unscanned `framework/` dir.) List the excluded siblings consciously, never by omission.
   - `--directed` is **required**. Without it the graph is undirected and total edge count blends
     incoming and outgoing — you cannot tell a healthy shared base (high fan-**in**) from a god
     class (high fan-**out**).
   - **Scoping does not exclude vendored code committed *inside* `<code-dir>`** (e.g.
     `application/libs/`, `src/vendor/`, a bundled third-party SDK) — those aren't
     gitignored, so graphify scans them and the graph drowns in someone else's classes
     instead of yours. Check `<code-dir>` for such folders before the first build; if
     any exist, add a `.graphifyignore` there first (see "In-tree vendored code" below).
4. **Relocate the `CLAUDE.md` section** the installer wrote: remove it from `CLAUDE.md` and
   instead add this file's `# Version` block and document title followed by the "Using" +
   "Refreshing" rules below to the project's `CODING_RULES.md`, replacing generic `.`/`src`
   references with the actual `<code-dir>`. **Pin the real code-dir explicitly** (e.g. a
   "This project's `<code-dir>` is `lib/`" line) so a later rebuild can't default to the repo
   root and trip the LLM pass. Keeping the version with the copied rules allows
   `/coding-rules:apply` to detect stale copies.
5. **gitignore the output** — build artifacts + cache, never committed:
   ```
   graphify-out/
   <code-dir>/graphify-out/
   ```
6. **Copy the refresh bat.** Copy `graphify_update.bat` (ships beside this file in
   `implementation_flow_addons/`) into the project's `tools/` folder and set its `CODE_DIR` to the real
   code dir. It runs the no-AI live-graph refresh (see "Refreshing after a code change" in
   `IMPLEMENTATION_FLOW.md`)
   and then smoke-tests the root graph (`god-nodes` + a sample `query`). See "Manual
   refresh bat" below.

## Folder layout (know which is which)

- `graphify-out/` at the **project root** = the **live graph** (`graph.json`, `GRAPH_REPORT.md`,
  `graph.html`). The only one queries read. Keep it `directed=True`.
- `graphify-out/cache/` at the project root = AST cache written by the CLI refresh (it runs
  with `GRAPHIFY_OUT` pointing at the root folder, see "Refreshing"). Scratch only.
- `<code-dir>/graphify-out/` = legacy AST cache from the skill build. Never the live graph
  under the documented flow; safe to delete. If a `graph.json` ever appears in there, a bare
  `graphify update` ran without `GRAPHIFY_OUT` — delete that `graph.json`, keep `cache/`.

## What the graph knows (and does not)

- Knows: code structure — classes, methods, calls, references, extends/implements, plus
  fan-in/fan-out and community / god-node structure.
- Does NOT know: business rules, API response shape, or rendered template/view output. It is a
  snapshot — stale until rebuilt. Constants referenced by string can appear as isolated nodes
  (AST limitation, not a missing dependency).

## Rules to paste into the project's CODING_RULES.md (only if the user opted in)

Prepend this file's `# Version` block and `# graphify Knowledge Graph (Optional Addon)` title
when copying the following sections. The flow-side sections (the delegate preamble and the
post-change refresh) live in `graphify_flow.md` and land in `IMPLEMENTATION_FLOW.md` instead —
opt into both files together.

### Using the graph

- For codebase questions, run `graphify query "<question>"` first when `graphify-out/graph.json`
  exists. `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships; `graphify explain "<concept>"` for a
  focused node. These return a small scoped subgraph vs. reading GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep.
- Judge coupling by direction: high **fan-in** + low fan-out (shared base / constants / DTO) is
  healthy; high **fan-out** (>~20 outgoing deps) is god-class risk and a refactor signal.
- Read `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` only for broad architecture review, or when
  query/path/explain do not surface enough context.


### Manual refresh bat (`tools/graphify_update.bat`)

Copied from the `graphify_update.bat` template beside this addon, adjusted (`CODE_DIR`).
Run it from anywhere — it `pushd`es to the repo root itself.

- **Does:** (1) the live-graph CLI refresh from "Refreshing after a code change" in
  `IMPLEMENTATION_FLOW.md` (sets `GRAPHIFY_OUT` to the root
  `graphify-out\`, passes the absolute code dir); (2) smoke test — prints the root
  graph's `directed` flag + node count, `god-nodes`, a sample `query`.
- **Does NOT:** re-extract docs (see "Doc changes" in `IMPLEMENTATION_FLOW.md`) or build a first graph — that is the
  skill flow (`/graphify <code-dir> --directed`).
- **When to use:** after a code change outside an AI session, or as a "is graphify still
  wired up?" check after cloning, a dependency change, or a graphify upgrade.

### In-tree vendored code — exclude it, scoping alone won't

`--directed`-scoping the build to `<code-dir>` keeps external `vendor/`/`node_modules/` out
automatically, but a **committed** third-party library living *inside* `<code-dir>` (a bundled
SDK, a copied library folder) is not gitignored, so graphify scans it like first-party code.
Symptom: god-nodes / oversized communities in `GRAPH_REPORT.md` whose class names belong to a
library, not the app (e.g. hundreds of `Facebook*`/`GraphNode*` nodes from an in-tree Facebook
SDK).

Fix once per project:

1. Spot the vendored folder(s) under `<code-dir>` (e.g. `application/libs/`). Committed
   **asset/sprite dirs** are the same kind of noise — bundled UI images (jQuery-UI/colorbox
   sprites, e.g. `extensions/backend/assets/images/`) aren't code but graphify still scans them;
   exclude them the same way.
2. Drop a `.graphifyignore` at the scan root (gitignore syntax, honored by default):
   ```
   # Vendored / third-party code + bundled assets — not our architecture, noise in the graph
   libs/
   ```
3. Rebuild with the CLI refresh plus `--force` — a narrower corpus is a *smaller* graph,
   which trips the shrink guard (#479):
   `GRAPHIFY_OUT="$PWD/graphify-out" graphify update --force "$PWD/<code-dir>"`.
   Do NOT delete `graphify-out/graph.json` first (see "Refreshing after a code change" in
   `IMPLEMENTATION_FLOW.md`: the CLI would rebuild
   it undirected and drop the doc nodes).
4. Verify: grep the vendored library's distinctive class name in the new `graph.json` — it
   should return only first-party code that *uses* the library (e.g. your own `FacebookManager`),
   never the library's own classes.
